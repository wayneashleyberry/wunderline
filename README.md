## Installation

```sh
npm install -g wunderline
```

## Authentication

Wunderline requires you to create your own Wunderlist application and store
the client id and an access token locally. You can create a new application
[here](https://developer.wunderlist.com/apps/new).

When creating an application you will be asked for an app url and an auth
callback url, you can just use dummy values for these.

Once that's done, click `CREATE ACCESS TOKEN` as highlighted here:

Your `ACCESS TOKEN` will show up above

Now you can run `wunderline auth` and enter the values.

### Adding Tasks

Add tasks to your inbox.

```sh
$ wunderline add Hello, World!
```

The add command also supports creating tasks from `stdin`.

```sh
$ cat todo.txt | wunderline add --stdin
```

You can also add tasks to a list, that list will be created if it doesn't
exist.

```sh
$ wunderline add Hello, World! --list Greetings
```

Due dates are now supported using one of the following options.

```sh
$ wunderline add Hello, World! --today --tomorrow --due 2015-12-25
```

You can add subtasks at task creation time.

```sh
$ wunderline add 'Run a marathon' --subtask 'Train for the marathon' --subtask 'Register for the marathon'
```

### Completing Tasks

Tasks can be completed using the `done` subcommand.

```sh
$ wunderline done
```

### Viewing Lists

All of Wunderlists smart lists are supported, so there are various ways to see
what tasks you have to do.

```sh
$ wunderline inbox
$ wunderline starred
$ wunderline today
$ wunderline week
$ wunderline all
```

Alternatively, you can view any other list by using the `list` subcommand.

```sh
$ wunderline list shopping
```

### Open

Open Wunderlist, defaults to opening the web app.

```sh
$ wunderline open
```

The only other platform currently supported is `mac`, use the `set-platform`
command to change your settings.

```sh
$ wunderline set-platform mac
```

### Export

Exports your data to stdout.

```sh
$ wunderline export > export.json
```

#### Filtering with jq

The export command will give you all of your data, unfiltered, which can be
a lot. If you'd like to search, filter or manipulate your data then check out
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

Here are some examples, filtering out completed and starred tasks.

```sh
wunderline export | jq '.data.lists[].tasks[] | select(.completed == true)'
```

```sh
wunderline export | jq '.data.lists[].tasks[] | select(.starred == true)'
```

## Bonus Points

### Ack / Ag

You could search for the word "todo" in a project and pipe the input into
wunderline. Each line will be parsed and turned into a task, be careful
because this could result in a **lot** of tasks!

This might be a terrible idea, even useless at best, but hopefully it will get
you thinking.

```sh
$ ag todo --nocolor --nofilename | wunderline add -s
```

### Debugging

wunderline uses [request](https://github.com/request/request) so if you
want to inspect api requests just set the `NODE_DEBUG` variable.

```sh
$ NODE_DEBUG=request wunderline inbox
```
